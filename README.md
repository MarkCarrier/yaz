A tool for writing and sharing text documents

## Why? 
As a programmer and writer, here's what I expect from my  tools:

* Quality version control. i.e. Git.
* Freedom in my choice of tools and data storage providers. This includes the ability to work using ssh and vi. I'm also currently partial to GitHub although this could change.
* High performance even with very large documents.
* Markdown support with a good level of customizability.
* Mobile friendliness
* Offline support
* Ability to share a document with others using a private URL.
* Minimalism.

All the tools I've tried failed at one of these. So here's my attempt at building something simple but powerful.

My primary goal is building something for myself perhaps this will be useful to others.
