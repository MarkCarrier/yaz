A tool for writing and sharing text documents

## Why? 
As a programmer and writer, here's what I've come to expect from my document workflow:

* Quality version control. i.e. Git.
* Freedom in my choice of text tools. This includes VSCode and vi.
* Freedom in my choice of data storage providers. I'm currently partial to GitHub although this could change.
* Clutter free online viewing of both private and shared documents without any manual sync process.
  * Private documents secured with login.
  * Shared documents secured with one or more private URLs.
* Markdown support.
* Good performance even with large documents (ideally up to 50,000 lines).
* Mobile friendliness.
  * Responsive views.
  * Easy to quickly create a new document.
  * No need to install a native app.
* Offline support.
* Minimalistic online editor.

All the tools I've tried thus far have failed in at least one of these areas. So here's my attempt at building something simple but effective.

My primary goal is building something for myself but perhaps this will be useful to others.
